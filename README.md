# Antimicrobial Resistance Gene and Pathotype Prediction

This repository contains the code and resources for predicting and classifying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and pathotypes based on antibiotic susceptibility data. We have applied three feature selection methods including Pearson's chi-squared test, Wald test, and a model-agnostic approach through DALEX packge to identify the most influential antibiotics for predicting each gene and pathotype.

## Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance poses a significant threat to public health. This repository focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict and classify AMR genes and pathotypes using antibiotic susceptibility data. Our goal is to provide a tool that can assist in identifying the most relevant antibiotics associated with specific genes and pathotypes.

## Features

- **Feature Selection Methods**: We have implemented three feature selection methods to identify the most important antibiotics for predicting AMR genes and pathotypes.

- **Prediction Models**: We provide machine learning models trained on a comprehensive dataset to predict the presence or absence of specific genes and pathotypes.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: We include evaluation metrics to assess the performance of our models, ensuring reliable predictions.
